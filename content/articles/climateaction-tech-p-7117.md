On 15th November, members of ClimateAction.tech (CAT) and climate tech-focused enthusiasts gathered online at our first India meetup. This gathering brought together tech enthusiasts, developers, entrepreneurs, and researchers from across India. We engaged in discussions about the diverse ways we leverage technology for climate solutions and promote sustainable technologies. 

The impact objectives of hosting regular meetups are:

To communicate the critical need for climate action within the tech sector in India.

To support each other on our individual climate tech journeys in India.

To build a network of individuals passionate about or aspiring to bring sustainability in the tech sector, and also who want to develop or use tech to combat the climate crisis.

The objective of this first meetup was to map the climate tech landscape of India. We held a virtual event in order to include participants from all regions of India, and used Miro as a platform to co-create this landscape.

About the participants

Locations of the participants depicted as CATs

We were a small, but diverse group from regions across India, including Mumbai, Pune, Chandigarh, Orai and Goa. We were brought together by an interest in digital sustainability. In a poll, participants cited personal passion, innovation and sustainability as motivators to be part of the meetup. Solving global challenges and contributing to community impact also emerged as significant factors.

We shared our feelings regarding our emotional responses to the climate crisis. Despite many feeling concerned, guilty, skeptical, scared, or angry about the world's current state, optimism emerged when discussing climate action. Collectively, we acknowledged the multifaceted emotions surrounding the current reality. We also recognised how a simple action, such as participating in a beach cleanup drive, cultivates a sense of belonging. As a result, everyone agreed that climate action empowers us to build resilience in our responses to climate change.

Our vision for India’s future 

The primary activity in the workshop was a discussion on the current landscape of climate tech and digital sustainability. A Miro board with pre-built categories roughly representing the current landscape was used. We shared how our current roles fit into this landscape, what our vision is, and where we aspired to be in the future. The meetup gave all of us an opportunity to discuss our concerns. It also provided a space to talk about our individual expertise such as computational geometry, data science, systems thinking, product development, agri tech, etc., that can help with solving climate change, Each one of us contributed to one or more of the following categories where we felt our individual expertise best fit: 

Green software and infrastructure (Software designed for efficiency, green websites, renewable energy management, smart grids, etc.)

We explored the need for data awareness and metrics on resource utilization, along with the emphasis of technical architecture design with a focus on sustainability. We acknowledged that we could achieve this through regular workshops and collaborations.

Green AI and ML (AI for climate modeling, carbon footprint analysis, sustainable agriculture)

To help build resilience against climate change, we discussed the use of Green AI and ML for flood and heat-risk forecasting in every district as well as for creating robust public infrastructure. As Indian agricultural soils face deep stress due to changing weather patterns, tech is needed to support intentional agriculture by providing spatially-aware data, soil-type-specific guidance. This should be driven by Satellite Data (Sentinel / Landsat) that can generate farmer usable insights for pest outbreak early warnings, evapotranspiration estimation, and irrigation scheduling.

As rainfall becomes more unpredictable and heatwaves increase, we investigated how AI could be used for flood and heat-risk forecasting in local areas. We also recognised the need for AI to be applied thoughtfully, with projects chosen based on their positive environmental impact compared to their carbon footprint.

Tech ethics and policy (Addressing bias in algorithms, data privacy for climate data, regulatory frameworks)

We envisioned a future where technology is used ethically and sustainability is the guiding principle. There was consensus that tech must empower individuals and organizations to create valuable products that operate on sustainable energy. 

Agritech & Food Systems (Precision farming, vertical farming, reducing food waste)

We imagined a future for India where tech is applied to bring efficiency in crop/food production and consumption as more than 30% food goes to waste. We aspired for roles to raise awareness and designing/optimizing supply chain and last mile connectivity. We also spoke about ways to work around regulations.

Climate Education & Awareness (Tech-driven learning platforms, engaging content creation)

We discussed the importance of promoting day-to-day sustainability practices and increasing access to credible sustainable products. We recognised that a healthy, livable, and sustainable planet is crucial for India's future. Our aspired role was to act as Climate Problem Communicators and Problem Solvers, working together with local communities to raise awareness..

Sustainable Design & Circular Economy (Product lifecycle analysis, waste reduction tech)

From addressing clothing waste management to water conservation, we explored the roles we could play in implementing sustainable solutions.

ESG (Designing software for ESG reporting)

Since climate action tech isn't just about using tech for climate action but also about employing it responsibly and making it sustainable, we recognised the need to publish the carbon footprint of tech used within an organization. We also agreed that the ESG sector should incorporate this information into their reporting. One way of doing this is by raising awareness through workshops focused on the importance of creating sustainable tech.

Climate Action (Tech for sustainability and sustainability for tech)

We all agreed that it's not just about tech but also about making people responsible for their local communities, which can help in reducing emissions at the source. By bringing discussions on climate change to local neighborhoods, we hope to inspire action. We believe this can be achieved through collaboration and climate action.

A peek at some of the discussion categories.

During the discussion, we explored not only tech solutions but also examined the current reality through a systemic lens of governance, policy, social norms, etc. We collectively agreed that policy and governance, coupled with technological interventions, are essential. This insightful exchange has motivated us to hold regular meetings, utilizing systems thinking as a primary tool. We eagerly anticipate increased participation from individuals in the tech sector at future gatherings.

Testimonials

"This session filled me with hope and a deep sense of belonging to a collective mission. Inspiring to see so many minds aligned toward the same climate-positive future."

– Yashi Gupta

I thoroughly enjoyed our first ever Indian meetup, where we had structured and insightful discussions on a broad range of climate topics with participants from diverse backgrounds. There was a strong aspiration among attendees to find ways they could meaningfully contribute to climate solutions, both from the ground up and through broader initiatives. Everyone agreed that urgent collective action is essential, and I hope many more will join us in this effort. I thank Siddhesh for taking up this initiative and make us come together.

– Vivek Vaddina

"Thank you Siddhesh for arranging this meetup. As I'm coming from the agriculture side, this session helped me understand how climate tech and digital sustainability can actually support farmers in a practical way. With Agrovation, my goal is to bring useful and intentional tech practices into agriculture things like data awareness, climate insights, and better decision-making tools for farmers. This meetup gave me clarity and confidence that we’re moving in the right direction, and it also inspired me to adopt more sustainable practices in our work. Thanks also to ClimateAction.tech for creating this space and pushing all of us to think deeper about climate action."
