10 years of BCorp UK – 10! 

In some ways 2015 feels like forever ago but also, yesterday. To get us in the mindset of 2015 – think rose gold everything, selfie sticks being a constant hazard, the word Brexit wasn’t in our lexicon and Adele dropped “Hello” (living rent free in our minds ever since!).

While 10 years seems like a lifetime, it’s hard to remember a time when we weren’t a BCorp. The ethos behind the movement has always been at the core of what we do. Our founders' original vision in 2007 was to create a better web for a better future. Ethical screening has been part of our business since 2009. What B Lab UK did is solidify that we are not alone in conducting our business with purpose. It pulled like-minded organisations together, creating community and fostering positive growth. Most importantly it created frameworks for others who didn’t know where to start.

Having certified in 2017, we have grown up alongside B Lab UK with many fun collaborations! The B Impact Assessment was a catalyst for our growth and gave us something to continually hold ourselves accountable too.

Let’s Take 10 to reflect on where we started and what we’re fired up about for the future!

In 2015 we introduced a no-fly policy.

In 2017, we were part of the 2nd cohorts of BCorp in the UK and launched the first version of the Website Carbon Calculator.

Joined 1% for the Planet in 2018 to date, supporting organisations like International Rivers, B Lab UK, Business Declares, The Green Web Foundation, Eden Project, Surfers Against Sewage, Solar Aid, Catalyse Change, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, COAST, and Re-Action Collective.

We released the Sustainable Web Manifesto and co-created the Sustainable Web Design Guidelines with MightyBytes.

In 2021, we worked with B Lab UK to build the Better Business Act website.

We only went and won a B Corp Best For The World accolade for Governance in 2022.

A true mark of growing up – in 2023 Tom & Vineeta graduated to Founders roles and brought in a Senior Leadership team that not only maintains Wholegrain’s values but builds on them.

We attended the largest gathering of BCorps in Oxford September 2024, a monumental moment packing out the whole city for 2 days!

2024 was a big year! Employee-led benefits were introduced and we took ethical screening to the next level by becoming Clean Creatives.

Finally in 2025, we launched the 4th version of Website Carbon Calculator! 

We’re very proud of the past, but honestly, reflecting on the last 10 years did fire us up for the future! Particularly for:

Seeing the Better Business Act become a legal requirement in the UK with an amended Section 172 of the Companies Act. You can pledge your business today on their website (designed & developed by us!).

Evolving people’s knowledge of digital sustainability from benchmarking to Human Web Principles. In a world where we can generate anything, how can we take a step back to create self-paced online experiences that are adaptable? We do have more on this to share with you..

Our team! With the introduction of non-bias recruitment, strong flexible working policies and employee led benefits – we are seeing incredible talent enquire to be part of our team. They aren’t hindered by location or stuffy CVs, we are prioritising the human behind the talent so they feel supported to do their best work possible.

This is our impact but there are over 2,600+ other BCorps in the UK alone. Each and every organisation has grown in the last 10 years spreading a network of purpose and positivity. We are driving the business world to a more impactful future. 

Take the time to see who in your network is a BCorp and where they’re demonstrating how powerful it is to lead your organisation with people, planet and purpose at the forefront.
