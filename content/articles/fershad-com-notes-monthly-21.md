September was a month for things to ramp down and other things to ramp up on the work front. Away from that, it was a pretty quiet month.

September 2025

👨🏼‍💻 As GAW ends, other stuff begins. The Grid-aware Websites (GAW) project has been the center of my attention at work for the last 12 months. I'm so proud of being able to build out the code library, deploy it to the Branch website, and work with Hannah and the outstanding group of individuals that we have in our advisory group. All that said, funding for the project ended in September and so we spent a lot of the month wrapping it up. There'll be a project reflection blog post that should come out sometime later this month which I'll share here too.

As GAW wrapped up, I shifted my attention to what will probably be my big project for the first half of 2026 which is to update the verification criteria we have at the Green Web Foundation. There'll be more about that on the Green Web Foundation blog in November so stay tuned over there.

🏉 Touch goals for 2026. There's a few international Touch tournaments coming up in 2026, and I'm still pretty keen to run around representing Taiwan as a player in those. As the body gets older though, it means that I need to start the preperation work a bit earlier to keep up with the pace of the game. The main aim is an Opens division tournament in Australia which I'm hoping to be selected for. With an eye to that, I've started getting in regular weekly gym sessions especially to build back the strength in my legs. October will be the month I begin supplementing that with some actual running, which I loathe.

Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current Start, stop, continue items for 2025. I've made one change to the "Start", removing drinking a glass of water every morning (that's become habitual) and replaced it with a goal to get 2 days at the gym in each week for the rest of the year.

Start

Tracking habits daily: 😔 Nope. I'm canning this one, it's not going to happen.

Carrying a water bottle with me: 😄 Yes!

2 days at the gym each week: 😅 Kinda. For two weeks, yes and for another two weeks I only managed one session.

Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list: 😅 Kinda. Not weekly, but I've got a links page which I'm now updating infrequently.

Cooking more regularly: 😔 Nope.

Stop

Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks: 😔 Kinda. It's hard during a brutal Taiwan summer with 7-11 around every corner!

Not waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them:😅 Kinda. I'm sitting on many project/writing ideas just because the time isn't there to do them.

Continue

Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan: 😔 Nope. Things have been quiet on this front.

Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day: 😄 Yes!
