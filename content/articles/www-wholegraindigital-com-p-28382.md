One of the most tantalising prospects of the internet is having the sum total of human knowledge just a couple of clicks away. The challenge is narrowing down all the options to find the relevant information you need.

If you’ve grown up in parallel with the internet as I have, you’ll have seen numerous ways of meeting this challenge. From narrow but reliable options like Encarta, to early search engines offering a glimpse into the wider world, to algorithms offering personalisation to nascent AI driven services and drivers, all are attempting the same thing; fast, relevant curation of information.

A challenge for membership platforms

For specialist membership platforms and content driven organisations this is an acute challenge. Audiences demand relevant, up to date and engaging content that cuts through the noise of the internet. Platforms need to find commercially viable ways of providing this type of content through subscriptions and premium tiers. Not only that, in a world of AI generated content and a challenging attention economy they also face challenges such as:

Whether to have a narrow or wide content focus? 

How to effectively curate content? 

How to stay relevant and engaging?

At Wholegrain we collaborate with our clients to help meet this challenge head on. Let’s dig a little deeper into the issue and then explore some of the solutions.

Curation methods

Content rarely arrives on CD-ROMs nowadays and curation takes a wide array of forms. For membership platforms we see three broad curation methodologies that work effectively:

Human driven curation on a specific topic

Organisations with a specialist focus provide trusted sources of expertise across the web. There are numerous examples but in a Wholegrain article it seems relevant to choose two that are close to our hearts.

Our client, Carbon Brief is a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science, climate policy and energy policy. Their site provides a wealth of well written, data rich content on a range of climate topics. Their daily briefing emails provide comprehensive breakdowns of the latest climate news. 

Our own Curiously Green newsletter does the same thing. We pull together the latest news, resources and regulations relating to the humane web and digital sustainability, sending regular emails to our subscribers. 

Human driven curation that pulls together narrative threads

A favourite newsletter among the Wholegrain Team is Dense Discovery. Described as “Thoughtfully curated links from a noisy web” it doesn’t focus on any particular topic. Rather it does an incredible job of tying together disparate topics and elements in a pleasing alchemy. We often end up seeing things that aren't usually part of our algorithms and we’re generally glad to see them. It’s a hard trick to pull off and needs an open minded reader to work effectively.

Away from the digital world, I thought of William Gibson’s Blue Ant series of novels here too. They weave popular culture, technology, fashion and global politics into coherent and connected narratives. Curation can be artful as well as commercial. 

Machine driven curation

You can split this into two broad sub categories, algorithmic and of course AI driven.

Algorithmic curation comes from machine learning based on user habits. Analysing user behaviour reveals patterns and connections allowing related and relevant recommendations to be made. Spotify springs to mind here. Its recommendation algorithm can provide a comfortable, familiar set of recommendations and playlists based on your listening habits, but informed by behaviours across the user base.

On the AI side of things I find a platform called Finchling an intriguing prospect. Describing itself as “Intelligent media monitoring” that “helps brands, comms & PR teams find press opportunities, and monitor what competitors are getting coverage for”. It pulls together relevant information for your organization and prioritizes risk and opportunity. 

Challenges and opportunities in content curation

The obvious opportunity here is that you can add value and retain an audience if you are providing information that is relevant to them. On the commercial side you can provide invaluable service within a sector. It can build brand authority and reputation as well as offering monetisation avenues. From a more holistic point of view you can share vital and important information with a wider audience, encouraging behaviour change. 

But there are challenges to doing content curation well too. If you make your focus too narrow users could lose the opportunity to make unexpected discoveries and links across topics. However, if you spread yourself too thin you risk losing relevance among your audience. 

I came back to Spotify here. As time went on I found that its algorithm became less effective. I was listening to less new music as my feed became more and more homogenous. It was frustratingly difficult to break new musical ground. I switched to Deezer and have found it does a better job but still not perfectly. Ultimately I find myself going to places like Six Music’s playlists to find new music. It’s curated by people with (I assume) similar music tastes to mine and an openness to new acts and genres. It’s doing what I found an algorithm could not.

Balancing access and gate keeping 

A particular challenge in the new media landscape is allowing access to your content while paying the bills. Paywalls can be vital for organisations but can put off digital natives who are used to free access. Adding value to your user base and providing exclusive info while keeping your casual audience engaged is a tricky balancing act. I find that 404 Media threads this needle quite well. Their articles are great and free to access for the most part. But the reporting they provide is niche enough to have a loyal, paying audience who see the value in the stories they tell.

Solving the problem with Humane Web Principles

Whatever methodology is most relevant to your organization, it won’t work effectively without a well thought out application or website to back it up. At Wholegrain we are guided by our Humane Web Principles when approaching these challenges. We build with the human in mind crafting self-paced online experiences for diverse needs. Curation is nothing without design choices that empowers audiences.

At the core of this is the Discovery Process. To make the right design choices and streamline curation workflows you have to answer certain questions. You need to know your audience and whether they want a narrow or wide focus to remain engaged. Are they only interested in a specific topic or are they open to being introduced to related areas by experts they trust?

Discovery always illuminates internal factors. It helps identify the key curators within a team and help enable them to effectively use the back end of a website. Interviews and discussions help identify the themes and content types within an organisation’s digital estate as well as how best to showcase them.

It can also help find tech solutions to help streamline workflows. Can analytics help identify what your audience resonates with? Can AI bring something to the party? Regardless of the tech side, it’s the humans in the process that provide the secret sauce. Why should someone subscribe to a membership service or newsletter if there isn’t human oversight taking time to organise and curate your information?

Wrapping up

Curation done well requires knowing your audience and an in-depth knowledge of the topics you are curating. The innate understanding of the topic comes from your experience and expertise and this, in turn, gives some insight into your audience too. However to really get to know your audience and their needs requires something more; discovery and iteration.

Taking time to confirm your understanding of your audience and their requirements is a must. The way we engage with our audience evolves over time along with their needs.

Testing, checking, and creating opportunities for growth from audience led insights. Reach out to our team if you would like to know more.
