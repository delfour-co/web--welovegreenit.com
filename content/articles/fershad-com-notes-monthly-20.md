August was a rare month for 2025, one where I was at home for the entire month!

August 2025

🍰 38 trips around the sun. The highlight of August, as it is every year, was my birthday. I normally don't do too much to celebrate. This year, Kay and I went to a new vegan restaurant that has opened near home to try it out.

🏉 3 week Touch tournament. I organised a 3 week Touch tournament during the month. Since it's Summer here the temperatures during the day can be pretty intense, so we ran a night tournament. It was small, with only three teams registering, but it was great getting folks together playing some regular Touch.

Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current Start, stop, continue items for 2025. I've made one change to the "Start", removing drinking a glass of water every morning (that's become habitual) and replaced it with a goal to get 2 days at the gym in each week for the rest of the year.

Start

Tracking habits daily: 😔 Nope.

Carrying a water bottle with me: 😄 Yes!

2 days at the gym each week: 😔 Not yet. Started in September ~~

Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list: 😔 Kinda. Not weekly, but I've got a links page which I'm now updating infrequently.

Cooking more regularly: 😔 Nope.

Stop

Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks: 😔 Kinda. It's hard during a brutal Taiwan summer with 7-11 around every corner!

Not waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them: 😄 Yes! Many a blog post have been published this month!

Continue

Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan: 😔 Nope. Things feel through with a local school in central Taiwan. Hopefully there'll be an opportunity later this year.

Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day: 😄 Yes!
